# Nhsuk Markdown Docs

This package is a custom theme for [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/) that allows you to easily create documentation sites using markdown.

Nextra is a lightweight wrapper around [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), that uses Static Site Generation to create a fast and easy to use documentation site.

Paired together, this package and Nextra allow you to create a documentation site with a sidebar, navigation, and more, with minimal effort and no configuration.
